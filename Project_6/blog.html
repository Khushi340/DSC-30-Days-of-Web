    <p>Feeling electrified to share with you all my first blog.<br>
      It is based on the days spent in doing projects on HTML, CSS, JS, BOOTSTRAP,Backend and<br> learning a lot from that.
Before the beginning of the course, I had a little knowledge on HTML<br> and CSS.First the course taught us about the basics of Github.As the course proceeded I came<br> across many new concepts that captivated me.<br><br> In the very first project, I coded to built my barebone Portfolio, then added styling(CSS) to it<br> for my second Project. And after that I learnt the concepts of Bootstrap using which I developed<br> a combined project.Then came the concept that made my portfolio interactive i.e., JavaScript.<br>By using which I also created a to-do List. Now, the time came for the backend part. Learning<br>Firebase hosting was the best part of this course for me.First, I made an account in firebase<br> website and created a new project.Afterwards I installed firebase tools and then deployed<br> my portfolio website by following the instructions provided.<br><br> I really enjoyed participating in this 30 days of Web Development. 
<br><br>
Happy Coding!!</p>
